I've been a part of our local Mozilla Community in New Delhi, a.k.a Mozpacers, for the better part of the year and all I can say is it's been an overwhelming experience. I've learned immensely from all our members and I hope I have offered the same experience to them. On top of our dedicated contributors we have our ever-so-supportive leads, namely Anup Kumar Mishra, Ajay Kumar and Bhuvnesh Kumar. I still cannot fathom the fact that Bhuvnesh drove more than 12 hours just so Sanyam And I don't face any problems during Dev Sprint v3\. **That's pure dedication!**

So, our community mentor, Anup attended Mozfest 2015 and he made us virtually present there as well, firstly, by constantly updating us on our whatsapp communication channel and, secondly, by taking a vidyo session when he came back to India. He enlightened us about theÂ  sessions he chose to attend such as how the iceberg model can help us and also about the various conversations he had there about our community.

The most striking knowledge to be gained out of the session was that leadership is not just about having a single person leading the entire community, it's about the entire community, it's about participation of the entire community. Each and every member of the community reflects it in a way no one else can. Each and every member is a leader in itself, the appointed leaders are said to have the task to guide everyone but they have an unsaid task as well. To motivate everyone, to never let their enthusiasm and dedication falter and to make sure that it's for all the right reasons. In turn, the people we motivate end up motivating us with their hard work and dedication. **It all comes full circle.**
